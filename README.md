# GLITCH ANIMATION STUDIO 

Proyecto de desarrollo web - DAW

## Description

We had to create a landing page for a fictional company in which we showed what we do, the different projects we have worked on, who each team member is, and what their role is. To do this, it was necessary to develop a workflow framework based on sprints, following Scrum principles. 

The project would thus be approached from the initial design all the way through development and later deployment to production.

As requirements of the initial brief, it was specified that only HTML and CSS were allowed for developing the code.

In our case, we chose to be the members of an animation studio dedicated especially to retro-futuristic anime from the 1990s and 2000s.
